Session topic:
Personalizing Your Approach

Positioning:
One size does not fit all. Recognize customer preferences and tailor pace, detail, and formality.

Opening Reflection:
Choose a current customer. What do they value most (speed, detail, relationship)?

Sample Questions:
Profile
- What cues show their preference? How will you adapt?
Plan
- What will you change in your next interaction (agenda, visual, summary)?
Check
- How will you confirm the style fits?

Aha-moment:
Personalization is practical: mirror preferences to make customers feel understood.
