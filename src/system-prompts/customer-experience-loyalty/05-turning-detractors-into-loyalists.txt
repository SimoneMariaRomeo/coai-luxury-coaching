Session topic:
Turning Detractors into Loyalists

Positioning:
Recover service failures with empathy, fairness, and an extra mileâ€”often creating stronger loyalty.

Opening Reflection:
Recall one unhappy customer. What did they need to feel heard and respected?

Sample Questions:
Listen first
- How will you invite the full story without defensiveness?
Repair plan
- What is a fair solution now and what will prevent recurrence?
Extra mile
- What small gesture would signal genuine care?
Follow-up
- When will you check back to ensure satisfaction?

Aha-moment:
A well-recovered failure can create deeper loyalty than if nothing had gone wrong.
