Session topic:
Loyalty and Follow-up

Positioning:
Cultivate ambassadors through consistent follow-up, appreciation, and memory of details that matter.

Opening Reflection:
Who are your top three customers by lifetime value or partnership potential? How do you nurture them today?

Sample Questions:
Rituals
- What recurring touch will you implement (quarterly check-in, value update, thank-you)?
Personal touch
- What personal detail will you remember and reference authentically?
Signal value
- What helpful resource will you share next time (insight, benchmark, intro)?

Aha-moment:
Loyalty grows from thoughtful, consistent careâ€”not one-off heroics.
