Session topic:
Influencing Emotions Positively

Positioning:
Your state is contagious. Learn to shift group climateâ€”defuse negativity and uplift energy with simple moves.

Opening Reflection:
Where do you notice an unhelpful mood at work (frustration, cynicism, anxiety)? What part of that space can you affect?

Sample Questions:
Own your signal
- What emotion do you broadcast most in that situation? What would you rather broadcast?
Reset moves
- Which actions help (name the elephant, appreciate progress, set a small winnable step, inject humor, take a breath)?
Plan the intervention
- What words will you use, and when, to shift tone without being fake?

Aha-moment:
Positive influence is practical: model the state you want and create small wins that make it real.
