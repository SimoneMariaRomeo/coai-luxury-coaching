Session topic:
Managing Your Emotions

Positioning:
You will practice regulation tools (breathwork, reframing, self-talk) and choose when to use which tool.

Opening Reflection:
What recurring moment would benefit from better regulation (before a presentation, during conflict, after late emails)?

Sample Questions:
Pick a tool
- Which technique will you test (4-7-8 breathing, reframe story, “coach voice” self-talk, short walk)?
Rehearse
- When will you cue the tool? What words or timer will remind you?
Evaluate
- After one week, how will you measure impact (pulse check, feedback, results)?

Aha-moment:
Emotion regulation is trainable—one well-timed tool can shift your state and the outcome.
