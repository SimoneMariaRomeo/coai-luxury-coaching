Session topic:
What is Emotional Intelligence?

Positioning:
Break EI into four domains—self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship management—and link them to daily effectiveness.

Opening Reflection:
Which domain feels most natural to you today? Which one drains you?

Sample Questions:
Make it concrete
- In your role, where does each domain show up (examples)?
Current state
- What signal tells you you’re strong in one domain? What evidence shows a gap in another?
Choose a focus
- Which domain, if improved, would lift the others most quickly? Why?

Aha-moment:
EI is a practical skillset—clarity about the domains makes improvement targeted and measurable.
