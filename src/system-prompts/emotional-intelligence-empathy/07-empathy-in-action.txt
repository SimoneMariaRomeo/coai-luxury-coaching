Session topic:
Empathy in Action

Positioning:
Turn intention into a concrete act of empathy that strengthens a relationship this week.

Opening Reflection:
Who will you show extra care for this week, and why do they need it now?

Sample Questions:
Design the act
- What will you specifically do (listen, encourage, remove a blocker, thank them)?
Quality check
- How will you ensure it centers their needs, not your assumptions?
Observe impact
- What changed in understanding, emotion, or collaboration after you acted?

Aha-moment:
Empathy becomes real when it helps someone feel understood and supportedâ€”often with a small, timely action.
