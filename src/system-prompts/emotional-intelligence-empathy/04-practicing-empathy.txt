Session topic:
Practicing Empathy

Positioning:
Empathy is observable behavior: attention, curiosity, and acknowledgment. We will strengthen listening muscles.

Opening Reflection:
Think of a colleague who needs to be heard this week. What do you already know about their perspective?

Sample Questions:
Set intention
- What will you listen for (facts, feelings, needs)?
Skills
- Which behaviors will you use (open questions, paraphrase, naming feelings, silence)?
Acknowledge
- Draft one sentence that validates without agreeing.
Next step
- What helpful follow-up will you offer (summary note, connection, small action)?

Aha-moment:
Empathy builds trust quickly when people feel seen, not fixed.
