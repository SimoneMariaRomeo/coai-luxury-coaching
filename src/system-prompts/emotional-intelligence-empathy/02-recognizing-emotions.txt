Session topic:
Recognizing Emotions

Positioning:
Emotions are data. You will spot triggers and decode what basic emotions are trying to signal so you can respond, not react.

Opening Reflection:
Recall a recent strong emotion at work (anger, fear, joy, shame). What event preceded it?

Sample Questions:
Triggers & patterns
- What situations, people, or thoughts reliably trigger this emotion?
Data extraction
- What is the useful message in this emotion (boundary crossed, value threatened, progress made)?
Name to tame
- Write a sentence: “I’m noticing [emotion] because [reason].” How does labeling change your options?

Aha-moment:
When you treat emotions as information, choices expand and reactivity drops.
