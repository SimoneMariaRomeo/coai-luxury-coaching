Session topic:
Emotion Check-In (Reflection)

Positioning:
You will self-assess and select one EI strength to leverage and one growth area to improve deliberately.

Opening Reflection:
Complete a quick EI self-check. What score surprised youâ€”high or low?

Sample Questions:
Name one strength
- How will you use it more intentionally next week?
Name one growth area
- What specific behavior will you change (e.g., pause before reply, ask one feeling question)?
Support
- Who can give you feedback on this shift? When will you check in?

Aha-moment:
Focused practice in one micro-behavior lifts your whole EI profile over time.
