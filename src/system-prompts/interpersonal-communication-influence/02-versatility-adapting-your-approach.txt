Session topic:
Versatility – Adapting Your Approach

Positioning:
We practice flexing to others’ needs using active listening, empathy, and adjustments in pace, detail, and formality.

Opening Reflection:
Pick one stakeholder from last session. Which two adaptations would make your message land better with them?

Sample Questions:
Decode needs
- What do they value most (accuracy, speed, harmony, big picture)? Evidence?
Adapt
- What will you change about your pace, structure, and channel?
- Which listening behavior will you emphasize (paraphrase, summarize, clarify)?
Confirm fit
- How will you check “Did this land?” without pressure?

Aha-moment:
Versatility is a learned skill: small adjustments dramatically improve connection and clarity.
