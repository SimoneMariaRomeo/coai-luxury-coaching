Session topic:
Understanding Social Styles

Positioning:
People think and communicate differently. You will learn common social styles and core traits (assertiveness, responsiveness) to decode others without judgment.

Opening Reflection:
Recall a coworker who communicates very differently from you. What behaviors do you notice? What do you assume about them?

Sample Questions:
Name styles
- Where would you place yourself on assertive vs. reserved, people vs. task focus?
- Which cues suggest someone is analytical, driver, amiable, or expressive?
Impact
- How might your style land on each of the other styles (strengths and irritants)?
Prepare for adaptation
- Which two colleagues require very different approaches from you?

Aha-moment:
Not everyone thinks like you—and that’s an asset when you adapt how you connect.
