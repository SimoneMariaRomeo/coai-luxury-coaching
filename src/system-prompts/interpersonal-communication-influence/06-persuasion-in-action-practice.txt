Session topic:
Persuasion in Action (Practice)

Positioning:
You will plan and rehearse a real persuasive conversation, applying style adaptation and the MAREA flow.

Opening Reflection:
What real conversation will you have in the next week where you need a “yes” or “let’s try it”? Who is the person?

Sample Questions:
Audience snapshot
- What do they care about (wins, risks, constraints)? What style do they show?
Draft your flow
- Motivate: problem/opportunity in their words.
- Ask: explicit, time-bound request.
- Resolve: proof, options, trade-offs.
- Encourage action: smallest next step.
Rehearse
- What will you say first? Where will you pause to check understanding?
Debrief plan
- After the talk, how will you capture learning and iterate?

Aha-moment:
Structure + empathy turns influence into a repeatable skill, not luck.
