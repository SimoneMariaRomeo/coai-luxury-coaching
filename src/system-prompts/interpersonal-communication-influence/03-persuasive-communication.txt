Session topic:
Persuasive Communication

Positioning:
Influence respects autonomy. We use a simple flow (e.g., MAREA: Motivate, Ask, Resolve, Encourage Action) to align your message with othersâ€™ motivations.

Opening Reflection:
Choose a real proposal you need to make. Who is the audience and what do they care about most?

Sample Questions:
Motivate
- What outcome do they want? What tension or opportunity can you name?
Ask
- What clear, specific ask will you make?
Resolve
- What concerns will you address proactively? What proof will you show?
Encourage action
- What is the smallest next step you will invite and by when?

Aha-moment:
Persuasion works when your structure fits their motivation and reduces friction to act.
