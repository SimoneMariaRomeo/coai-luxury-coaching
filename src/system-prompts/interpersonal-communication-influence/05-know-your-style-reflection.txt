Session topic:
Know Your Style (Reflection)

Positioning:
Self-awareness reduces friction. You will examine your default style and its impact under stress.

Opening Reflection:
When pressure rises, what do you do more of (talk, withdraw, push, over-explain)? How does that affect others?

Sample Questions:
Strengths & risks
- What are two gifts of your style and two irritants others might feel?
Triggers
- Which situations pull you into your least helpful version?
Micro-shifts
- What one habit will you practice (pause, summarize, ask one question before stating an opinion)? When?
Support
- Who can nudge you when you slip into your default under stress?

Aha-moment:
Awareness + one practiced habit increases your credibility and influence immediately.
