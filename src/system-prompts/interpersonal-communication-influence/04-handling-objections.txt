Session topic:
Handling Objections

Positioning:
Objections are data, not defiance. Use M.I.L.D. (Mirror, Inquire, Legitimize, Deal) to understand and address concerns while preserving trust.

Opening Reflection:
What objection do you expect in your proposal? What do you think it really means?

Sample Questions:
Mirror
- Reflect the concern in their words. How will you show you heard them?
Inquire
- What clarifying question will uncover root causes (risk, effort, timing)?
Legitimize
- How will you acknowledge the feeling/logic without conceding prematurely?
Deal
- What options or trade-offs could meet their need and yours?
Close the loop
- How will you confirm whether the concern is addressed?

Aha-moment:
Handled well, objections become the path to agreementâ€”not a barrier.
