Session topic:
Finding Win-Win

Positioning:
Shift from positions to interests. When needs are understood, creative options appear.

Opening Reflection:
Pick a current friction. What does each side really need (not just want)?

Sample Questions:
Interests
- What underlying needs, constraints, and success criteria exist on both sides?
Options
- Brainstorm 3–5 ways to meet more needs with the same or fewer resources.
Objective criteria
- What standards or data could guide a fair choice?
Next step
- What small experiment could you try to test a promising option?

Aha-moment:
Needs-first thinking opens space for solutions that aren’t visible from fixed positions.
