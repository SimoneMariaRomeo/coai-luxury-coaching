Session topic:
Rethinking Conflict

Positioning:
Healthy conflict fuels clarity and innovation. Learn conflict types and Thomas–Kilmann styles to choose the right approach.

Opening Reflection:
Think of a recent disagreement. What was beneficial about it—and what wasn’t?

Sample Questions:
Map the situation
- Was the conflict about facts, methods, goals, or values?
Your default
- Which style do you use most (avoid, accommodate, compete, compromise, collaborate)?
Fit for purpose
- Given stakes and relationship, which style would serve best now?
Prepare one move
- What would collaborating look like here (shared problem, criteria, options)?

Aha-moment:
Conflict is a tool. The value depends on how you use it, not whether it exists.
