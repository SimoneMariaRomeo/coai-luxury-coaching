Session topic:
Navigating Difficult Behaviors

Positioning:
You can’t control others, but you can control your response. Use calm presence, boundaries, and reframing to keep progress possible.

Opening Reflection:
Who is one “difficult” counterpart, and what specific behavior makes it hard for you?

Sample Questions:
De-personalize
- What might be driving their behavior (pressure, fear, habit)?
Your response plan
- What will you do to stay composed (breath, pause, slow voice)?
- What boundary or process will you propose (time-box, agenda, one voice at a time)?
Reframe
- What neutral language turns attacks into issues to solve?

Aha-moment:
Respect + boundaries keep you effective even when others are not at their best.
