Session topic:
Conflict Resolution in Practice

Positioning:
Apply the journey: clarify perceptions, address needs, agree process, and take a first step.

Opening Reflection:
Choose a minor ongoing conflict you can influence. What would “better” look like next week?

Sample Questions:
Prepare
- What’s your neutral summary of both views? What needs are at stake?
Plan
- Which process will you suggest (agenda, time-box, options, decision rule)?
Act
- What first small action will you take within 48 hours?
Reflect
- After the attempt, what changed and what will you adjust?

Aha-moment:
Small, respectful moves reduce tension and build momentum toward solutions.
