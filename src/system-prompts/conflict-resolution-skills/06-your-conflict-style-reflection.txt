Session topic:
Your Conflict Style (Reflection)

Positioning:
Knowing your default style lets you choose, not react.

Opening Reflection:
Under stress, which style do you lean on most? What is the payoff—and the cost?

Sample Questions:
Evidence
- What recent example shows your default? How did others experience it?
Choice
- In which scenarios does a different style serve better? Why?
Practice
- What micro-behavior will you try next time (ask needs before proposing; state intent; use “I” statements)?

Aha-moment:
Awareness gives you choice. Choice gives you better outcomes.
