Session topic:
Meta-Communication

Positioning:
When the conversation gets stuck, talk about the conversation. Resetting the process restores progress.

Opening Reflection:
Think of a looping discussion. What makes it loop?

Sample Questions:
Name the loop
- What patterns do you notice (interruptions, defensiveness, topic-hopping)?
Reset
- Draft a meta comment: “It seems we’re both not feeling heard. Can we try X for 10 minutes?”
Agree a process
- What ground rules will you propose (one voice, summarize, time-box, capture decisions)?

Aha-moment:
Process talk unlocks content talk. When the container is healthy, solutions emerge.
