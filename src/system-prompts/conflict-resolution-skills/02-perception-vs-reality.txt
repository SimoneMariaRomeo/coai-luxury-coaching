Session topic:
Perception vs. Reality

Positioning:
Misunderstandings often fuel conflict. We will catch mental traps (mind-reading, overgeneralizing) and seek the other’s view accurately.

Opening Reflection:
Where might you be misreading someone’s intent right now?

Sample Questions:
Name assumptions
- What story are you telling yourself? What facts do you actually have?
Test perceptions
- What neutral question could surface their view? What would you learn if you were wrong?
Shared picture
- What facts do you both agree on? Where is the uncertainty?

Aha-moment:
Accuracy beats certainty. Seeing the other’s viewpoint clearly reduces unnecessary conflict.
