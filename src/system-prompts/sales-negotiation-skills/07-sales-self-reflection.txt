Session topic:
Sales Self-Reflection

Positioning:
Review a recent sale or negotiation to identify the stage that needs practice next.

Opening Reflection:
Which stage challenged you most (discovery, objection handling, closing)? Why?

Sample Questions:
Evidence
- What exact moment was hard? What did you try? What was the effect?
Upgrade
- What will you do differently next time (new questions, proof, close)?
Practice plan
- When is your next conversation to apply this change?

Aha-moment:
Consistent reflection upgrades the entire funnel, one stage at a time.
