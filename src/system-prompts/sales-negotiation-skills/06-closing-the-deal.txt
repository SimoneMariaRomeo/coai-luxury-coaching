Session topic:
Closing the Deal

Positioning:
Use trial closes, assumptive closes, and last-mile objection handling to help customers say yes confidently.

Opening Reflection:
What would the customer need to see or feel to say yes today?

Sample Questions:
Signals
- What buying signals have you observed? What concerns remain?
Toolkit
- Which close fits (summary/trial close, assumptive next step, time-bound pilot)?
Confidence
- What risk-reducer can you offer (pilot, opt-out, reference)?

Aha-moment:
Closing is serviceâ€”helping the customer commit to the value they already see.
