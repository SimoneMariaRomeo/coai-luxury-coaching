Session topic:
Uncovering Needs (SPIN)

Positioning:
Use SPIN (Situation, Problem, Implication, Need-payoff) to reveal explicit and latent needs.

Opening Reflection:
For your opportunity, what do you know about the customerâ€™s situation and problem today?

Sample Questions:
S & P
- What clarifying S and P questions will you ask?
Implication
- What happens if the problem persists (costs, risks)? What questions will surface that?
Need-payoff
- How will you ask about outcomes they would value if the problem were solved?
Evidence
- What proof will you later bring that maps to these needs?

Aha-moment:
Great discovery lets customers convince themselves by articulating the value they want.
