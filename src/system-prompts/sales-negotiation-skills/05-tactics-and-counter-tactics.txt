Session topic:
Tactics and Counter-tactics

Positioning:
Recognize common bargaining plays (silence, extreme anchors, good cop/bad cop) and respond without losing poise.

Opening Reflection:
Which tactic unsettles you mostâ€”and how do you usually react?

Sample Questions:
Name the play
- What tactic might you face in this deal? What is it trying to do?
Counter
- How will you respond (pause, re-anchor, ask criteria, return to interests)?
Stay centered
- What breath or note will help you keep calm and curious?

Aha-moment:
Tactics lose power when you label them and return to objective criteria and interests.
