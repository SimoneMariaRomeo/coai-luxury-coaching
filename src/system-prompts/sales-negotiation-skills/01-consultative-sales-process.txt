Session topic:
The Consultative Sales Process

Positioning:
Selling is value creation across stages: open, discover, propose, resolve, close. We map the journey and your role in each step.

Opening Reflection:
Think of one current opportunity. Which stage is it in, and what does progress look like?

Sample Questions:
Stage clarity
- What outcome signals completion of this stage?
Next move
- What customer action do you want next (meeting, data, access)?
Value at each step
- How will you make the customer better off in this stage (insight, checklist, prototype)?

Aha-moment:
A great close is the natural end to great discovery and proposal work. Each stage earns the next.
