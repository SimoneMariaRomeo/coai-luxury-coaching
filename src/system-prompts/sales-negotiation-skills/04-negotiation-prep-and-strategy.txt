Session topic:
Negotiation Prep and Strategy

Positioning:
Plan before you bargain. Clarify BATNA and ZOPA; choose collaborative or competitive tactics as context requires.

Opening Reflection:
What is your BATNA if this deal does not close? What do you think theirs is?

Sample Questions:
Boundaries
- What is your walk-away? What is your ideal? What is realistic?
Interests
- What do both sides truly need (beyond price)?
Strategy
- Where can you expand value (scope, timing, risk-sharing)? Where must you hold firm?
Process
- What agenda and decision path will you propose?

Aha-moment:
Preparation creates confidence. Strategy beats improvisation.
