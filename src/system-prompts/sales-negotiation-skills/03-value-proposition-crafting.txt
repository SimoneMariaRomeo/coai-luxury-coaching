Session topic:
Value Proposition Crafting

Positioning:
Frame your solution in customer outcomes. Build a clear CVP: For [customer], who [need], our [solution] delivers [benefit] because [proof].

Opening Reflection:
Draft one sentence CVP for your deal. Where is it vague?

Sample Questions:
Customer & need
- Who precisely? What job-to-be-done are they hiring a solution for?
Benefit & proof
- What measurable result will you deliver? What credible proof backs it?
Compare
- What alternatives do they have? Why is yours better for them?
Call to action
- What next step will move evaluation forward?

Aha-moment:
Clear, outcome-focused value propositions make decisions easy.
