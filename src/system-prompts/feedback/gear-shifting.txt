**Session: Gear Shifting Techniques**

Today we're learning one of the most advanced skills in feedback: how to handle resistance and shift gears when the conversation isn't going well.

**What is Gear Shifting?**
Gear shifting is the ability to change your approach when the other person is resistant, defensive, or not responding well to your feedback.

**The Three Gears:**

**1. Telling (Direct Approach):**
- "Here's what I observed and here's what needs to change"
- Use when the person is open and receptive
- Most effective when you have a strong relationship

**2. Asking (Inquiry Approach):**
- "What's your perspective on what happened?"
- Use when the person seems defensive or resistant
- Helps them feel heard and understood

**3. Listening (Supportive Approach):**
- "Tell me more about what you're experiencing"
- Use when the person is emotional or overwhelmed
- Focuses on understanding their situation

**When to Shift Gears:**

**From Telling to Asking:**
- When the person becomes defensive
- When they start making excuses
- When they seem to shut down
- When the conversation becomes one-sided

**From Asking to Listening:**
- When the person becomes emotional
- When they seem overwhelmed
- When they need to vent or process
- When they're not ready to problem-solve

**The Gear Shifting Process:**

**1. Notice the Resistance:**
- Are they becoming defensive?
- Are they making excuses?
- Are they shutting down?
- Are they becoming emotional?

**2. Acknowledge Their Experience:**
- "I can see this is difficult for you"
- "It sounds like you're feeling frustrated"
- "I understand this might be hard to hear"

**3. Shift Your Approach:**
- **To Asking:** "What's your perspective on what happened?"
- **To Listening:** "Tell me more about what you're experiencing"
- **Back to Telling:** "Now that I understand your perspective, here's what I observed"

**4. Find Common Ground:**
- "We both want this to work out"
- "I can see you care about doing a good job"
- "Let's figure out how to move forward together"

**Your Practice Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: The Defensive Response**
You give feedback about being late, and they respond: "It's not my fault, the traffic was terrible, and anyway, everyone else is always late too."

**How would you shift gears?**
- What would you say to acknowledge their experience?
- How would you move from telling to asking?
- What questions would you ask to understand their perspective?

**Scenario 2: The Emotional Response**
You give feedback about interrupting, and they start to cry and say: "I'm just trying to help, and now you're criticizing me for caring too much."

**How would you shift gears?**
- What would you say to show you care?
- How would you move from telling to listening?
- How would you help them process their emotions?

**The Key Principles:**

**1. Stay Curious:**
- What's really going on for them?
- What's their perspective on the situation?
- What might be driving their behavior?

**2. Show Empathy:**
- Acknowledge their feelings
- Validate their experience
- Show that you understand

**3. Maintain Your Goal:**
- Don't lose sight of what you're trying to achieve
- Be patient with the process
- Stay focused on the outcome

**Your Reflection:**
1. What's your natural response when someone becomes defensive?
2. How comfortable are you with shifting gears mid-conversation?
3. What would help you feel more confident about handling resistance?
4. How can you practice these skills in low-stakes situations?
5. What support do you need to develop your gear-shifting abilities?

**The Next Step:**
Once you can shift gears effectively, we'll work on creating a culture of continuous feedback and learning.
