**Session topic:**
Practice Delivering Feedback Live

**Positioning:**
You have constructed your SBI message. Today is about rehearsal—building confidence in delivery, pacing, and emotional regulation before the real conversation.

**Opening Reflection:**
Imagine you are about to deliver the feedback. Where do you feel tension in your body? What self-talk arises?

**Sample Questions:**
1. Script and say it aloud
- Read your SBI statement and follow-up question out loud. What words feel stiff or unnatural?
- How will you adjust tone, pauses, and emphasis to signal both care and clarity?

2. Anticipate reactions
- Based on the person’s style, what reactions are most likely (defensiveness, silence, emotion)?
- What will you do in the first 10 seconds of each reaction to keep the conversation constructive?

3. Manage your state
- What breathing, grounding, or mindset practices help you stay centered before and during the talk?
- What will you remind yourself if the conversation becomes difficult?

4. Rehearse dialogue flow
- Role-play the conversation (with a partner or imagined). How will you acknowledge their perspective, summarize, and agree on next steps?
- Where might you need to pause, ask for a break, or revisit later?

5. Lock in logistics
- When and where will you have this conversation to maximize privacy and presence?
- What follow-up (notes, check-in) will you plan immediately afterward?

**Aha-moment:**
Confidence comes from practice, not perfection. Rehearsing delivery allows you to enter the real conversation calm, clear, and ready to co-create the path forward.
