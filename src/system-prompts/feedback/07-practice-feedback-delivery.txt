**Session: Practice Feedback Delivery**

Now that you understand the SBI model, let's practice delivering feedback in a way that creates positive change and strengthens relationships.

**The Feedback Delivery Framework:**
Effective feedback delivery involves both what you say and how you say it.

**1. Set the Stage:**
- Choose the right time and place
- Ensure privacy and minimize distractions
- Check that both of you are in the right frame of mind

**2. Use the SBI Model:**
- **Situation:** "During yesterday's team meeting..."
- **Behavior:** "I noticed you interrupted Sarah three times..."
- **Impact:** "This made Sarah seem frustrated and the team missed out on her ideas..."

**3. Ask for Their Perspective:**
- "What was your experience of that situation?"
- "How did you see what happened?"
- "What were you thinking at the time?"

**4. Listen Actively:**
- Give them your full attention
- Don't interrupt or defend
- Ask clarifying questions
- Acknowledge their perspective

**5. Collaborate on Solutions:**
- "What would work better for you?"
- "How can we prevent this from happening again?"
- "What support do you need?"

**6. Follow Up:**
- Set a time to check in
- Acknowledge improvements
- Provide ongoing support

**Your Practice Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: The Late Team Member**
**Situation:** Team member has been arriving late to meetings
**Your SBI feedback:** "During the past three team meetings, you've arrived 10-15 minutes after we started. This has meant we've had to repeat information and it's disrupted the flow of our discussions."

**Practice the conversation:**
- How would you set the stage?
- What questions would you ask?
- How would you collaborate on solutions?

**Scenario 2: The Dominating Colleague**
**Situation:** Someone consistently interrupts and dominates team discussions
**Your SBI feedback:** "In today's meeting, you spoke for 15 minutes straight and interrupted Sarah three times when she was trying to share her idea. This made Sarah seem frustrated and the team missed out on what could have been a valuable contribution."

**Practice the conversation:**
- How would you approach this person?
- What would you say to show you care about them?
- How would you work together on a solution?

**The Emotional Intelligence Factor:**
Effective feedback delivery requires emotional intelligence:

**Self-Awareness:**
- How are you feeling about this situation?
- What's your motivation for giving this feedback?
- Are you in the right emotional state to have this conversation?

**Social Awareness:**
- How might the other person be feeling?
- What's their current situation or stress level?
- How can you show that you care about them?

**Relationship Management:**
- How can you maintain trust and respect?
- What's the best way to approach this person?
- How can you make this a positive experience?

**Your Reflection:**
1. What's your natural style when giving feedback?
2. What emotions do you typically feel when giving feedback?
3. How do you think the other person might be feeling?
4. What would make you feel more confident about giving feedback?
5. What support do you need to improve your feedback delivery?

**The Next Step:**
Once you can deliver feedback effectively, we'll work on handling resistance and creating a culture of continuous feedback.
