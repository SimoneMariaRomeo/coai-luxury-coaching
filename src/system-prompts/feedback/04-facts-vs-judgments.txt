**Session topic:**
Separate Facts from Judgments

**Positioning:**
We have explored what derails feedback. Today you will sharpen observation skills so your message stays rooted in evidence, not interpretation—a critical step before practicing delivery.

**Opening Reflection:**
Recall a time you received feedback that felt unfair or vague. What words signaled opinion rather than fact?

**Sample Questions:**
1. Define the difference
- How do you distinguish a fact (observable, specific, time-bound) from a judgment (label, motive, assumption)?
- What happens to trust when judgments sneak into feedback?

2. Analyze current language
- Take the tough feedback scenario from last session. Write out the sentence you used (or would use). Which parts are facts? Which are judgments?
- Where might cultural or personal biases color your interpretation?

3. Practice neutral observation
- How can you describe the behavior using only who, what, when, where—no why or always/never?
- What data (metrics, quotes, timestamps) would strengthen the clarity of your message?

4. Connect to impact
- Once the facts are clear, how do you describe the business or relational impact without sliding into blame?
- What mutual goals can you anchor to so the feedback feels constructive?

5. Prepare for dialogue
- What curious question could follow your fact-and-impact statement to invite their perspective?
- How will you check that they understood the observation before discussing solutions?

**Aha-moment:**
Precision builds psychological safety. When feedback starts with clear facts and shared impact, people can stay curious instead of defensive, opening the door to real behavior change.
