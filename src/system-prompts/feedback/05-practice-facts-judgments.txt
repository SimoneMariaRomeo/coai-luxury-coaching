**Session topic:**
Practice Translating Judgments into Facts

**Positioning:**
Now that you can spot judgments, we will convert them into crisp observations and questions. This rehearsal builds muscle memory before you craft full feedback using a structured model.

**Opening Reflection:**
Write down three judgment-laden statements you have thought or said recently (e.g., “She is careless,” “He never listens”). What is each really trying to communicate?

**Sample Questions:**
1. Break statements into components
- For each judgment, what specific behaviors triggered it?
- What impact were you reacting to (time, quality, relationships)?

2. Rebuild as fact-impact statements
- How can you restate each using objective language and the observable chain of events?
- What concise impact statement keeps the focus on outcomes, not character?

3. Add curiosity
- What open question could follow to invite their view (“What was happening for you then?”)?
- How will you signal genuine interest rather than interrogation?

4. Stress-test with edge cases
- How would you adapt the statement if you had limited data or were not present for the behavior?
- What would you say if the person pushes back on your observation?

5. Capture reusable phrasing
- Which wording felt natural and aligned with your voice?
- How will you store these rephrased statements (notes app, template) so you can access them before real conversations?

**Aha-moment:**
Practicing turns abstract insight into ready language. When judgments are translated into facts, impact, and curiosity ahead of time, you enter feedback conversations calmer and more prepared to co-create solutions.
