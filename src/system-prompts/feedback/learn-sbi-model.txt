**Session: Learn the SBI Model**

Today we're learning one of the most powerful frameworks for giving effective feedback: the SBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact) model.

**What is the SBI Model?**
The SBI model provides a clear, structured way to give feedback that focuses on specific behavior and its impact, without making judgments about the person.

**The Three Components:**

**1. Situation:**
- When and where did this happen?
- What was the context or setting?
- What was the specific moment or event?

**2. Behavior:**
- What specific actions did you observe?
- What did the person say or do?
- Focus on observable, verifiable behavior

**3. Impact:**
- What was the result or consequence?
- How did it affect you, the team, or the project?
- What was the outcome or impact?

**The SBI Structure:**
"**Situation:** [When and where]
**Behavior:** [What you observed]
**Impact:** [What happened as a result]"

**Example 1 - Positive Feedback:**
"**Situation:** During yesterday's client presentation
**Behavior:** You prepared a detailed analysis of their current challenges and proposed three specific solutions
**Impact:** The client was impressed and asked us to move forward with the project, which will bring in $50,000 in revenue"

**Example 2 - Developmental Feedback:**
"**Situation:** In last week's team meeting
**Behavior:** You interrupted Sarah three times while she was explaining her proposal
**Impact:** Sarah seemed frustrated and didn't finish sharing her idea, and the team missed out on what could have been a valuable contribution"

**The Power of SBI:**
- **Specific:** Focuses on particular moments and behaviors
- **Objective:** Based on observable facts, not interpretations
- **Impact-focused:** Shows why the behavior matters
- **Actionable:** Gives clear information for improvement

**Your Practice Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: The Great Presentation**
Think of a time when someone gave a great presentation or contribution. Use the SBI model to give them feedback:

**Situation:** [When and where did this happen?]
**Behavior:** [What specific actions did you observe?]
**Impact:** [What was the result or consequence?]

**Scenario 2: The Missed Opportunity**
Think of a time when someone's behavior had a negative impact. Use the SBI model to give them feedback:

**Situation:** [When and where did this happen?]
**Behavior:** [What specific actions did you observe?]
**Impact:** [What was the result or consequence?]

**The Receiving Side:**
When someone gives you feedback using the SBI model:

1. **Listen to the situation** - understand the context
2. **Focus on the behavior** - what specific actions are they referring to?
3. **Consider the impact** - how did your behavior affect others?
4. **Ask clarifying questions** - "Can you give me more details about what you observed?"
5. **Share your perspective** - "From my perspective, here's what I was thinking"

**Your Reflection:**
1. What's the difference between SBI feedback and judgment-based feedback?
2. How would you feel receiving feedback using the SBI model?
3. What's challenging about giving SBI feedback?
4. How can you practice this model in your daily interactions?
5. What's one specific situation where you could use the SBI model?

**The Next Step:**
Once you understand the SBI model, we'll practice applying it in real situations and develop your ability to give feedback that actually works.
