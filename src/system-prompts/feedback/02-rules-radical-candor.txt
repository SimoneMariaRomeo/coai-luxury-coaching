**Session topic:**
Learn the Rules of Radical Candor

**Positioning:**
You have named what blocks your feedback. Today we anchor on a simple framework—Radical Candor—that balances courage and care so your feedback lands as partnership, not punishment.

**Opening Reflection:**
Think about someone you owe honest feedback. When you imagine speaking up, which feels riskier: being too blunt or not clear enough? What does that say about how you balance care and challenge?

**Sample Questions:**
1. Understand the two dimensions
- What does “Care Personally” look like in your relationships (behaviors, rituals, language)?
- What does “Challenge Directly” sound like when you do it well—and when you avoid it?

2. Explore the four quadrants
- Radical Candor (high care, high challenge)
- Ruinous Empathy (high care, low challenge)
- Obnoxious Aggression (low care, high challenge)
- Manipulative Insincerity (low care, low challenge)
Where do you typically land with different people?

3. Diagnose real situations
- For the person you identified, which quadrant describes your current default?
- What evidence or feedback tells you that is how they experience you?

4. Define the shift toward Radical Candor
- What would it mean to dial up care before, during, and after the conversation?
- What would it mean to dial up challenge so the message is unmistakably clear?

5. Set a practice target
- Who will you practice Radical Candor with in the next week, and on what topic?
- What preparation will help you stay anchored in both care and challenge when emotions rise?

**Aha-moment:**
Radical Candor is a balancing act: when care and challenge move together, people hear the truth and feel supported. Leaning too far to one side creates either silence or harm. Knowing the quadrant you are in is the first step to changing it.
