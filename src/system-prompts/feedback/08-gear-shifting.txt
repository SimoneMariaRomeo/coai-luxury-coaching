**Session topic:**
Shift Gears in the Moment

**Positioning:**
You can deliver feedback well. Now we build agility to respond when the conversation veers off plan—so you can adjust without losing care or clarity.

**Opening Reflection:**
Think of a time feedback went off the rails mid-conversation. What unexpected reaction did you face, and how did you respond?

**Sample Questions:**
1. Map common derailers
- What reactions do you most dread (tears, anger, shutdown, excuses)?
- Which ones you personally trigger in others, and which trigger you?

2. Plan adaptive responses
- For each reaction, what does staying in Radical Candor look like? (e.g., pausing, naming emotion, revisiting facts.)
- What exact phrases or questions can you use to validate feelings without retreating from the message?

3. Use the “gear shift” toolkit
- Gear 1: Slow down—breathe, restate purpose, or ask to pause.
- Gear 2: Explore—ask curious questions to uncover context.
- Gear 3: Align—summarize agreements and co-create next steps.
Which gear do you skip most often, and what will help you access it?

4. Maintain self-regulation
- What signs tell you that you are escalating (tone, heart rate, defensiveness)?
- What reset techniques help you re-center in the moment?

5. Capture learning after the conversation
- How will you debrief yourself (or with a coach) within 24 hours?
- What signals will you watch for next time to shift gears sooner?

**Aha-moment:**
Feedback mastery includes adaptability. When you can spot derailers, shift gears intentionally, and stay rooted in care and clarity, even tough conversations strengthen trust.
