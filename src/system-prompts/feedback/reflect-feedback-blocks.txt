- Uncertainty about what to focus on
- Difficulty finding the right words

**4. Past Negative Experiences:**

**5. Cultural or Organizational Barriers:**
- Working in environments where feedback isn't valued
- Lack of feedback culture
- Hierarchical structures that discourage honest dialogue

**Your Personal Reflection:**
Let's explore what might be blocking you specifically:

**Think about a time when you wanted to give feedback but didn't:**
- What stopped you?
- What were you afraid might happen?

**Think about a time when you received feedback that was difficult:**
- What made it challenging?

**Your Insight Challenge:**
What's your biggest feedback block? What would need to change for you to feel more comfortable with feedback? What support would you need?
