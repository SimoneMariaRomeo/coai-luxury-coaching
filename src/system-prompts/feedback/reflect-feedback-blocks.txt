Session topic:
Reflect on Feedback Blocks

Positioning:
Today you will identify what blocks you from giving and receiving useful feedback and how to remove those blocks. The outcome is a simple, safe, repeatable way to turn feedback into progress.

Opening Reflection:
Think of one person who does something that creates problems for you. You have not told them yet, or you tried and it failed. Who is it, and what specific behaviors did you notice?

Sample Questions:

Surface the moment
- What exactly did they do or say? When and where does it happen most?
- What is the concrete impact on work or the relationship?
Name the block
- What stopped you from saying something, or made you soften it?
- Which fits best: fear of harm to the relationship, fear of conflict, status gap, identity threat, lack of words, timing, cultural norm?
- If you tried and it went poorly: what do you think they heard, and what might have triggered that reaction?
Perspective shift
- From their side, what might be true about their intent, constraints, or pressures?
Test assumptions and costs
- What is the cost of staying silent for you, for them, for the team?
- What is the likely upside of a respectful conversation?
Identify options
- What outcome would you hope for if the talk went well?
- What words or question could open the door without blaming?

Aha-moment:
When care and clarity are both present feedback becomes what it should be: a gift. Blocks like fear of harm, status distance, identity threat, or vagueness push us to avoid or attack. Name the block, choose a small respectful step, and feedback turns into shared progress and better performance or relationship.
