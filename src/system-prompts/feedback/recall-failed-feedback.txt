**Session: Recall Failed Feedback**

Today we're going to learn from past experiences where feedback didn't work as intended. This is one of the most powerful ways to understand what makes feedback effective.

**The Learning from Failure:**
When feedback fails, it's usually not because the message was wrong, but because of how it was delivered or received. Let's explore what went wrong and what we can learn.

**Think about a time when you gave feedback that didn't work:**
- What was the situation?
- What did you say?
- How did the other person respond?
- What was the outcome?
- What do you think went wrong?

**Think about a time when you received feedback that didn't work:**
- What was the situation?
- What did the other person say?
- How did you respond?
- What was the outcome?
- What made it ineffective?

**Common Reasons Why Feedback Fails:**

**1. Timing Issues:**
- Giving feedback when emotions are high
- Waiting too long after the incident
- Choosing a public or inappropriate setting
- Not considering the other person's state of mind

**2. Delivery Problems:**
- Being too vague or general
- Focusing on personality instead of behavior
- Using judgmental or accusatory language
- Not being specific enough about the impact

**3. Relationship Issues:**
- Lack of trust or rapport
- Not having established care and respect
- Previous negative experiences
- Power dynamics that create defensiveness

**4. Content Problems:**
- Focusing on what went wrong instead of what could improve
- Not providing specific examples
- Not explaining the impact or consequences
- Not offering solutions or next steps

**5. Receiving Issues:**
- Being defensive or closed off
- Not asking clarifying questions
- Making assumptions about the other person's intentions
- Not being ready to hear the feedback

**The Learning Opportunity:**
Every failed feedback experience is a learning opportunity. The key is to understand what went wrong and how to do it differently next time.

**Your Analysis:**
For your failed feedback experiences:

**What went wrong?**
- Was it the timing, delivery, relationship, content, or receiving?
- What specific factors contributed to the failure?
- What could you have done differently?

**What would you do differently?**
- How would you approach the situation now?
- What would you say differently?
- How would you create a better environment for the feedback?

**The Insight:**
Most feedback failures are not about the message itself, but about the context, relationship, and delivery. When you understand what went wrong, you can prevent it from happening again.

**Your Reflection:**
1. What's the most important lesson you've learned from failed feedback?
2. What pattern do you notice in your feedback failures?
3. What would need to change for you to give feedback more effectively?
4. What would need to change for you to receive feedback more effectively?
5. What's one specific situation where you could apply these lessons?

**The Next Step:**
Once you've identified the patterns in your feedback failures, we'll work on developing the skills to avoid these common pitfalls and give feedback that actually works.

What insights are you gaining about what makes feedback fail and how to prevent it?
