**Session: Rules of Radical Candor**

Today we're diving into the framework that will transform how you think about feedback: Radical Candor.

**What is Radical Candor?**
Radical Candor is the ability to challenge directly while caring personally. It's about being honest and direct while maintaining genuine care for the other person.

**The Radical Candor Framework:**
The framework is built on two dimensions:

**1. Challenge Directly (X-axis):**
- Are you willing to say what needs to be said?
- Do you avoid difficult conversations?
- Are you clear and specific about what needs to change?

**2. Care Personally (Y-axis):**
- Do you genuinely care about the other person's success?
- Do you invest in building relationships?
- Do you show that you want them to succeed?

**The Four Quadrants:**

**1. Radical Candor (High Challenge + High Care):**
- "I care about you, and I need to tell you something that might be hard to hear"
- This is the sweet spot for effective feedback
- People feel safe to receive honest feedback because they know you care

**2. Obnoxious Aggression (High Challenge + Low Care):**
- "You're wrong, and I don't care how you feel about it"
- This is feedback without empathy or relationship
- It damages relationships and creates defensiveness

**3. Ruinous Empathy (Low Challenge + High Care):**
- "I care about you, so I won't tell you what you need to hear"
- This is avoiding difficult conversations to protect feelings
- It prevents growth and can lead to bigger problems later

**4. Manipulative Insincerity (Low Challenge + Low Care):**
- "I don't really care, and I won't tell you the truth"
- This is the worst of both worlds
- It creates confusion and mistrust

**The Key Principles:**

**1. Get to Know People:**
- Understand their goals, motivations, and challenges
- Show genuine interest in their success
- Build trust through consistent care

**2. Give a Damn:**
- Care about the person, not just the performance
- Invest in their development and growth
- Celebrate their successes and support them through challenges

**3. Don't Personalize:**
- Focus on behavior and impact, not personality
- Separate the person from the performance
- Avoid making it about who they are as a person

**4. Don't Apologize for Caring:**
- It's okay to care about people at work
- Showing care makes feedback more effective
- It's not unprofessional to be human

**Your Practice Challenge:**
Think about your current relationships at work:

**For each person, consider:**
- How well do you know them personally?
- Do they know you care about their success?
- When was the last time you gave them feedback?
- How comfortable are you being direct with them?

**The Insight:**
The more you care about someone, the more direct you can be. When people know you genuinely want them to succeed, they're more open to hearing difficult feedback.

**Your Reflection:**
1. Which quadrant do you naturally fall into with most people?
2. What would need to change for you to move toward Radical Candor?
3. Who do you have the strongest Radical Candor relationship with? What makes it work?
4. Who do you need to build more care with? How might you do that?
5. What's one specific situation where you could practice Radical Candor?

**The Next Step:**
Once you understand the framework, we'll work on developing the skills to challenge directly while caring personally.

What insights are you gaining about the importance of both challenge and care in feedback?
