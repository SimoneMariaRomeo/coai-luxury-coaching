**Session: Practice Facts vs Judgments**

Now that you understand the difference between facts and judgments, let's practice applying this skill in real situations.

**The Practice Framework:**
We'll work through several scenarios to help you develop the muscle memory for fact-based feedback.

**Scenario 1: The Late Team Member**
**Situation:** A team member has been arriving late to meetings for the past two weeks.

**Judgment-based feedback:** "You're always late and it's disrespectful to the team"
**Fact-based feedback:** "I noticed you arrived 10 minutes after the meeting started today, and 15 minutes late last Tuesday"

**Your turn:** How would you give feedback about this situation using only facts?

**Scenario 2: The Interrupting Colleague**
**Situation:** During team discussions, someone consistently interrupts others and dominates the conversation.

**Judgment-based feedback:** "You're being rude and not letting others speak"
**Fact-based feedback:** "During today's meeting, you spoke for 15 minutes straight and interrupted Sarah three times when she was trying to share her idea"

**Your turn:** How would you give feedback about this situation using only facts?

**Scenario 3: The Missed Deadline**
**Situation:** A team member missed a project deadline that affected the entire team.

**Judgment-based feedback:** "You don't care about the team's success and you're unreliable"
**Fact-based feedback:** "The project was due on Friday, and you delivered it on Monday, which meant the rest of the team had to work over the weekend"

**Your turn:** How would you give feedback about this situation using only facts?

**The Fact-Based Feedback Structure:**
1. **Describe the specific behavior** you observed
2. **Explain the impact** it had on you or others
3. **Ask for their perspective** on what happened
4. **Collaborate on solutions** for moving forward

**Your Practice Scenarios:**
Now, think of a real situation where you need to give feedback:

**Situation:** [Describe the situation]
**Facts only:** [What specific behaviors did you observe?]
**Impact:** [What was the result or consequence?]
**Your feedback:** [How would you deliver this feedback using only facts?]

**The Receiving Side:**
It's also important to practice receiving fact-based feedback:

**When someone gives you feedback:**
1. **Listen without defending** - focus on understanding what they observed
2. **Ask clarifying questions** - "Can you give me a specific example?"
3. **Acknowledge the impact** - "I can see how that affected you"
4. **Share your perspective** - "From my perspective, here's what I was thinking"
5. **Collaborate on solutions** - "What would work better for you?"

**Your Reflection Practice:**
Think about a time when you received feedback that felt judgmental:

**What made it feel judgmental?**
**How did you respond?**
**What would have made it easier to receive?**
**How might you have responded differently?**

**The Insight:**
Fact-based feedback creates a foundation for honest, productive conversations. When people feel heard and understood, they're more open to change and improvement.

**Your Commitment:**
What's one specific situation where you can practice giving fact-based feedback? What will you say? How will you prepare for the conversation?

**The Next Step:**
Once you can consistently separate facts from judgments, we'll work on structuring your feedback conversations for maximum impact.

What insights are you gaining about the power of fact-based feedback?
