**Session topic:**
Apply the SBI Feedback Model

**Positioning:**
Your observations are sharp. Today we assemble them into the Situation-Behavior-Impact (SBI) structure so you can deliver feedback that is clear, respectful, and easy to discuss.

**Opening Reflection:**
Think of the feedback conversation you are preparing for. What do you know about the situation, the behavior, and the impact—and where are the gaps?

**Sample Questions:**
1. Clarify the Situation
- When and where did the behavior happen? Who was involved?
- What context must be shared so they can immediately picture the moment?

2. Describe the Behavior
- Using your fact-based language, how will you articulate exactly what they did or said?
- What will you avoid mentioning to keep it objective and concise?

3. Explain the Impact
- What was the effect on results, team dynamics, customers, or you personally?
- How can you share impact without blame—linking back to shared goals or standards?

4. Plan the dialogue
- What question will you ask after SBI to invite their perspective (“How do you see it?”)?
- How will you listen and respond if their view differs from yours?

5. Bridge to next steps
- What options or support could you offer once you align on the facts and impact?
- How will you agree on ownership and follow-up without turning it into a monologue?

**Aha-moment:**
SBI keeps feedback anchored in reality while leaving space for partnership. When Situation, Behavior, and Impact are clear, the conversation naturally turns toward solutions instead of defensiveness.
