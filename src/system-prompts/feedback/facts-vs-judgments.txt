**Session: Facts vs Judgments**

Today we're exploring one of the most critical skills in effective feedback: distinguishing between facts and judgments.

**The Problem with Judgments:**
When we give feedback based on judgments, we create defensiveness and resistance. People naturally want to defend themselves against judgments, even when they're accurate.

**What are Facts?**
Facts are observable, verifiable information that anyone could see or hear:
- "You arrived 15 minutes late to the meeting"
- "You sent the report on Friday at 3 PM"
- "You spoke for 20 minutes during the presentation"
- "You asked three questions during the discussion"

**What are Judgments?**
Judgments are interpretations, opinions, or assumptions about what the facts mean:
- "You're always late" (judgment about pattern)
- "You don't care about the project" (judgment about motivation)
- "You're not a team player" (judgment about character)
- "You're being difficult" (judgment about intention)

**The Impact of Each:**

**Facts:**
- Create clarity and understanding
- Are difficult to dispute
- Focus on specific, observable behavior
- Allow the other person to draw their own conclusions

**Judgments:**
- Create defensiveness and resistance
- Are open to interpretation and dispute
- Focus on personality or character
- Put the other person in a position to defend themselves

**The Skill of Fact-Based Feedback:**
The goal is to describe what you observed without interpreting what it means.

**Instead of:** "You're not committed to this project"
**Say:** "I noticed you missed the last three team meetings"

**Instead of:** "You're being defensive"
**Say:** "When I mentioned the deadline, you said 'That's not my fault' and crossed your arms"

**Instead of:** "You don't listen"
**Say:** "When I was explaining the process, you were looking at your phone and didn't respond to my questions"

**Your Practice Challenge:**
Think about a recent situation where you wanted to give feedback. How would you describe it using only facts?

**The Situation:** [Describe the situation]
**What you observed:** [List the specific, observable behaviors]
**What you felt:** [Your emotional response]
**What you thought:** [Your interpretation or judgment]

**Now, practice giving feedback using only facts:**
- What specific behaviors did you observe?
- What was the impact on you or others?
- What would you like to see happen differently?

**The Insight:**
When you focus on facts, you give the other person the opportunity to:
- Understand exactly what you observed
- Draw their own conclusions about the impact
- Decide how they want to respond
- Take ownership of their behavior

**Your Reflection:**
1. What's the difference between what you observed and what you interpreted?
2. How might the other person see the same situation differently?
3. What would it feel like to receive feedback based only on facts?
4. What's challenging about separating facts from judgments?
5. How can you practice this skill in your daily interactions?

**The Next Step:**
Once you can distinguish between facts and judgments, we'll work on structuring your feedback to focus on observable behavior and its impact.
