**Session topic:**
Design Your Feedback Action Plan

**Positioning:**
You have built awareness, skill, and agility. Today you consolidate your learning into a feedback cadence and support system that sustains Radical Candor beyond this journey.

**Opening Reflection:**
Looking back over the sessions, what shifts in mindset or behavior are you most proud of? Where do you still feel hesitation?

**Sample Questions:**
1. Set priority conversations
- Which feedback conversations will you initiate in the next 30 days? What is the objective of each?
- How do these conversations advance team performance, relationships, or culture?

2. Establish rhythms and rituals
- What regular practices will keep feedback flowing (weekly 1:1 agenda item, retros, quick pulses)?
- How will you invite feedback about yourself to model reciprocity?

3. Define support structures
- Who will hold you accountable to practicing Radical Candor (mentor, peer, team)?
- What resources or tools do you need ready (templates, reflection logs, prompts)?

4. Anticipate obstacles
- What barriers could slow you down (time, avoidance, organizational norms)?
- What pre-commitments or triggers will help you notice and counter those barriers?

5. Measure progress
- What leading and lagging indicators will show your feedback culture is improving?
- How will you celebrate wins and course-correct when you miss the mark?

**Aha-moment:**
Sustained feedback excellence is intentional. A clear action plan—with conversations scheduled, rhythms in place, allies engaged, and metrics defined—turns Radical Candor into a lasting part of how you lead.
