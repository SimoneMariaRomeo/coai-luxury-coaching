**Session: Define Feedback Action Plan**

Congratulations! You've completed your feedback mastery journey. Now it's time to create a concrete action plan to apply everything you've learned.

**Your Feedback Development Summary:**
Over the past sessions, you've:
- Identified your feedback blocks and how to overcome them
- Learned the Radical Candor framework for challenging directly while caring personally
- Analyzed failed feedback experiences to understand what went wrong
- Developed the skill of distinguishing between facts and judgments
- Practiced giving fact-based feedback in various scenarios
- Mastered the SBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact) model for structured feedback
- Practiced delivering feedback in a way that creates positive change
- Learned gear-shifting techniques for handling resistance

**The Action Plan Framework:**
Now we'll create a specific, actionable plan to implement these concepts in your daily feedback practice.

**Step 1: Choose Your Focus**
Select one relationship or situation to focus on first. This should be someone where you can make a meaningful impact and practice your new skills.

**Step 2: Assess Your Current Feedback Relationship**
For this person, consider:
- What's your current feedback relationship like?
- How comfortable are you giving them feedback?
- How do they typically respond to feedback?
- What would need to change for feedback to be more effective?

**Step 3: Choose Your Approach**
Based on your assessment, select the appropriate approach:
- **Radical Candor:** High challenge + High care
- **SBI Model:** Situation-Behavior-Impact structure
- **Gear Shifting:** Telling → Asking → Listening as needed

**Step 4: Plan Your Feedback Conversation**
Structure your approach:
- **Set the stage:** When and where will you have this conversation?
- **Use SBI:** What specific situation, behavior, and impact will you discuss?
- **Show care:** How will you demonstrate that you care about their success?
- **Handle resistance:** How will you shift gears if they become defensive?

**Step 5: Practice Your Delivery**
Prepare for the conversation:
- What will you say exactly?
- What questions will you ask?
- How will you show empathy and understanding?
- What solutions will you collaborate on?

**Step 6: Follow Up and Build Momentum**
Plan for ongoing feedback:
- How will you follow up on this conversation?
- What regular feedback will you provide?
- How will you celebrate improvements?
- How will you handle future challenges?
