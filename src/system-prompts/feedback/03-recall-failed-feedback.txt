**Session topic:**
Dissect a Failed Feedback Moment

**Positioning:**
You have the Radical Candor lens. Today we use it to unpack a feedback conversation that went sideways so you can extract lessons and redesign your next attempt.

**Opening Reflection:**
Bring to mind the toughest feedback exchange you have had in the past year. What happened, and how did you feel as it unfolded?

**Sample Questions:**
1. Reconstruct the conversation
- What words did you use to open, deliver the message, and close?
- How did their body language, tone, or words shift along the way?

2. Analyze with the Radical Candor grid
- In each moment, which quadrant were you operating from?
- Where did you over-index on care or challenge—and why?

3. Identify hidden triggers
- What stories or assumptions about them (or yourself) were in play?
- What needs, fears, or identities might they have been protecting?

4. Surface missed opportunities
- Where could you have invited their perspective or clarified intent sooner?
- What data or examples were missing that would have made the message undeniable and still respectful?

5. Rehearse an improved version
- If you could replay it, how would you prepare differently? How would you open, frame impact, invite response, and close?
- What support or ally could help you test the new script before you use it live?

**Aha-moment:**
Feedback misfires are rich data. When you slow down to observe what happened through the Radical Candor lens, you uncover precise moments to adjust—transforming past pain into a blueprint for future effectiveness.
