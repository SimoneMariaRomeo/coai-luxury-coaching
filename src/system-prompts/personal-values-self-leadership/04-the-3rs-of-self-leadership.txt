Session topic:
The 3Rs of Self-Leadership

Positioning:
Practice Remember (lessons), Reorganize (skills), Resist (quitting on principles and habits). Small disciplines compound.

Opening Reflection:
What recent success can you dissect for lessons? What habit helped it happen?

Sample Questions:
Remember
- What did you do that worked? What will you repeat?
Reorganize
- Which skill or knowledge should you sharpen next? How?
Resist
- What principle or habit will you protect when projects get hard?

Aha-moment:
Simple rhythms of reflection, learning, and discipline build self-leadership over time.
