Session topic:
Personal Leadership Reflection

Positioning:
Take stock: when are you at your best, and what derails you? Choose one habit to build and one to reduce.

Opening Reflection:
Finish: “I’m at my best when… I lose momentum when…”

Sample Questions:
Patterns
- What environments and routines help you thrive? Which ones drain you?
Habits
- What habit will you add (e.g., morning planning, weekly learning)? What habit will you reduce (doom scroll, email at night)?
Support
- Who can keep you honest? How will you check in?

Aha-moment:
Self-leadership improves when you intentionally tilt the environment in favor of your best self.
