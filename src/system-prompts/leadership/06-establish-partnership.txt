**Session topic:**
Co-Create Partnership Agreements

**Positioning:**
Armed with insight about needs and your own leadership patterns, it is time to build shared agreements with key stakeholders. These agreements clarify expectations, coaching rhythms, and decision rights.

**Opening Reflection:**
Select one stakeholder where a new agreement would unlock momentum. What is currently assumed, fuzzy, or causing friction between you?

**Sample Questions:**
1. Clarify mutual goals
- What outcome do you both need to achieve in the next 60–90 days?
- How does this connect to the broader strategy or customer impact?

2. Define roles and decision boundaries
- For this work, what decisions should they own, and where do you stay close?
- Which decisions require a consult or approval, and how will you make that visible?

3. Set support and accountability rhythms
- Given their development level, what cadence of check-ins, coaching, or resources will accelerate progress?
- How will you track commitments and signal when escalation is needed?

4. Invite their voice
- What support do they want from you? What do they not want?
- What commitments do they need from you to feel trusted and empowered?

5. Document and socialize
- How will you capture this agreement (email, doc, shared workspace)?
- Who else must understand these boundaries so they reinforce—not erode—the agreement?

**Aha-moment:**
When leader and stakeholder co-create clear agreements, accountability feels shared, not imposed. The right structure gives people room to grow while keeping support and expectations explicit.
