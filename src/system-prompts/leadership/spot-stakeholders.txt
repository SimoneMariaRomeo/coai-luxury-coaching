**Session: Spot Your Stakeholders**

Now that you understand the Situational Leadership model, let's apply it to your real-world situation. Today, we're going to identify and assess your key stakeholders.

**Who Are Your Stakeholders?**
Your stakeholders are the people whose success you influence and who influence your success. This includes:
- Direct reports
- Peers and colleagues
- Your manager
- Key clients or customers
- Cross-functional partners

**The Assessment Process:**
For each stakeholder, we need to determine their development level on the tasks that matter most to your working relationship.

**Key Questions to Ask:**
1. **Competence**: How skilled are they at the specific tasks they need to perform?
2. **Commitment**: How motivated and confident are they about these tasks?
3. **Context**: What's their experience level with similar challenges?

**The Development Level Indicators:**

**D1 - Enthusiastic Beginner:**
- New to the role or task
- Eager to learn but needs guidance
- Asks many questions
- May overestimate their abilities

**D2 - Disillusioned Learner:**
- Has some experience but hit obstacles
- Confidence has been shaken
- May be frustrated or disengaged
- Needs both direction and encouragement

**D3 - Capable but Cautious:**
- Has the skills but lacks confidence
- May second-guess themselves
- Needs reassurance and support
- Ready to take more ownership

**D4 - Self-Reliant Achiever:**
- Experienced and confident
- Takes initiative and ownership
- Can work independently
- Ready for delegation

**Your Assessment Challenge:**
Think about your most important stakeholders. For each person, consider:
- What are the key tasks or responsibilities they have?
- What's their competence level for these tasks?
- What's their commitment level?
- What development level does this suggest?

**The Insight:**
Remember, the same person can be at different development levels for different tasks. A marketing manager might be D4 for campaign strategy but D1 for budget management.

**Your Reflection:**
Which stakeholders are you most confident about assessing? Which ones are more challenging to evaluate? What additional information might you need?

**The Next Step:**
Once you've identified their development levels, you'll be ready to choose the most appropriate leadership style for each relationship.

Let's start with your direct reports. Who are they, and what's your assessment of their current development level?
