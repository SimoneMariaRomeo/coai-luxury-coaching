**Session: Explore Leadership Styles**

Now that you've assessed your stakeholders' development levels, let's explore how to match the right leadership style to each situation.

**The Four Leadership Styles in Detail:**

**1. Directing (S1) - High Directive, Low Supportive**
- **When to use**: D1 development level (Enthusiastic Beginner)
- **What it looks like**: Clear instructions, close supervision, frequent check-ins
- **Key behaviors**: 
  - Provide specific, step-by-step directions
  - Set clear expectations and deadlines
  - Monitor progress closely
  - Give immediate feedback
- **Communication style**: "Here's exactly what to do, and I'll check in with you daily"

**2. Coaching (S2) - High Directive, High Supportive**
- **When to use**: D2 development level (Disillusioned Learner)
- **What it looks like**: Direction with encouragement and support
- **Key behaviors**:
  - Explain the "why" behind decisions
  - Provide guidance while building confidence
  - Offer encouragement and emotional support
  - Help problem-solve obstacles
- **Communication style**: "Let me show you how, and I'll be here to support you through this"

**3. Supporting (S3) - Low Directive, High Supportive**
- **When to use**: D3 development level (Capable but Cautious)
- **What it looks like**: Encouragement and support with less direction
- **Key behaviors**:
  - Ask questions to help them think through solutions
  - Provide resources and remove obstacles
  - Offer encouragement and recognition
  - Facilitate their decision-making
- **Communication style**: "You know what to do, and I'm here if you need help"

**4. Delegating (S4) - Low Directive, Low Supportive**
- **When to use**: D4 development level (Self-Reliant Achiever)
- **What it looks like**: Minimal direction and support
- **Key behaviors**:
  - Set overall objectives and boundaries
  - Provide resources and authority
  - Monitor results, not process
  - Celebrate successes and learn from failures
- **Communication style**: "You've got this, let me know how it goes"

**The Art of Style Matching:**
The key is to match your leadership style to the person's development level for the specific task at hand.

**Your Practice Challenge:**
Think about your stakeholders from our previous session. For each person:
1. What development level are they at for their key responsibilities?
2. Which leadership style would be most appropriate?
3. What specific behaviors would you need to demonstrate?
4. How would you communicate with them?

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Using the same style with everyone
- Sticking with one style regardless of the situation
- Assuming someone's development level based on their job title
- Not adjusting your style as people develop

**The Development Journey:**
Remember, as people develop, you need to adjust your style. Someone who starts as D1 should eventually become D4, and your leadership approach should evolve accordingly.

**Your Reflection:**
Which leadership style feels most natural to you? Which feels most challenging? What might be holding you back from using certain styles?

**The Next Step:**
Once you've identified the appropriate styles for your stakeholders, we'll work on developing your ability to flex between different approaches.

Let's start with your most important stakeholder. What development level are they at, and which leadership style would be most effective?
