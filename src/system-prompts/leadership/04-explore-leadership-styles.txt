**Session topic:**
Match Leadership Styles to Development Needs

**Positioning:**
With your stakeholder map in place, today we translate development levels into concrete leadership moves. You will clarify which blend of direction and support each person needs right now.

**Opening Reflection:**
Choose one stakeholder-task pair from your map. When you interact today, do you default to giving instructions, asking questions, stepping back, or stepping in? What effect does that have on their progress?

**Sample Questions:**
1. Revisit the situational leadership styles
- S1 Directing: high direction, low support.
- S2 Coaching: high direction, high support.
- S3 Supporting: low direction, high support.
- S4 Delegating: low direction, low support.
What behaviors do you personally associate with each style?

2. Diagnose current style use
- For the chosen stakeholder-task, which style do you naturally adopt today?
- Where have you seen it accelerate or stall their growth or ownership?

3. Experiment with style shifts
- If their development level calls for a different style, what would you add, reduce, or stop doing?
- Which phrases, rituals, or tools could embody that adjusted style in your next interaction?

4. Anticipate resistance (yours and theirs)
- What inner narrative might make it hard for you to lead with more direction or more space?
- How might they react when you change your approach? How can you frame the shift so it lands as support?

5. Broaden the application
- Looking at the rest of your map, where else are you over- or under-leading?
- What cadence will help you revisit style choices as people progress?

**Aha-moment:**
Situational leadership is not theoryâ€”it is a set of visible behaviors. When direction and support are intentionally calibrated to the development need, momentum returns and trust deepens.
