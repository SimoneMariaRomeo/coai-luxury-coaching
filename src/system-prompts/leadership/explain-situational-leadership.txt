**Session: Explain Situational Leadership**

Today we're diving deep into the Situational Leadership model, a framework that will transform how you approach leading others.

**The Core Concept:**
Situational Leadership is based on the principle that there is no single "best" leadership style. Instead, effective leaders adapt their approach based on two key factors:
1. The **development level** of the person they're leading
2. The **specific task** or situation at hand

**The Four Development Levels:**
Let me explain each development level and what it means for your leadership approach:

**D1 - Enthusiastic Beginner:**
- High commitment, low competence
- Excited about new challenges but lacks experience
- Needs clear direction and close supervision
- **Your leadership style: Directing** (high directive, low supportive)

**D2 - Disillusioned Learner:**
- Low commitment, some competence
- Has hit some obstacles and lost confidence
- Needs both direction and encouragement
- **Your leadership style: Coaching** (high directive, high supportive)

**D3 - Capable but Cautious:**
- Variable commitment, high competence
- Has the skills but lacks confidence
- Needs support and encouragement to take ownership
- **Your leadership style: Supporting** (low directive, high supportive)

**D4 - Self-Reliant Achiever:**
- High commitment, high competence
- Experienced and confident
- Ready for delegation and autonomy
- **Your leadership style: Delegating** (low directive, low supportive)

**The Key Insight:**
The same person can be at different development levels for different tasks. A senior developer might be D4 for coding but D1 for leading a team.

**Your Learning Challenge:**
Think about your team members. Can you identify which development level each person is at for their current responsibilities? What evidence supports your assessment?

**The Leadership Styles in Action:**
- **Directing**: "Here's exactly what to do, and I'll check in frequently"
- **Coaching**: "Let me show you how, and I'll be here to support you"
- **Supporting**: "You know what to do, and I'm here if you need help"
- **Delegating**: "You've got this, let me know how it goes"

**Your Reflection:**
Which of these styles feels most natural to you? Which feels most uncomfortable? Why do you think that is?

This framework will help you become more intentional and effective in your leadership approach. What questions do you have about these concepts?
