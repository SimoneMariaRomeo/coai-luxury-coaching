**Session topic:**
Reflect on Your Ideal Leader

**Positioning:**
Welcome to your first leadership development session. Today, we're going to explore your leadership philosophy by reflecting on what you consider to be an ideal leader.

**Opening Reflection:**
Think about the best leader you've ever worked with or observed. What made them exceptional? What specific behaviors, qualities, or approaches did they demonstrate that you admired?

**Sample Questions:**
1. Anchor in a Role Model
Who has been your strongest leadership role model?
What aspects of their style do you most admire?
2. Connect to Self
How has that role model shaped your own leadership approach?
Where does this style work well for you?
3. Test the Limits
Can you think of a situation where your role-model-inspired style did not work as well as you hoped?
Why do you think it was less effective there?
4. Compare Perspectives
Have you seen someone with a very different style also lead successfully?
What does that suggest about the idea of one “best” leadership style?
5. Apply to the Team
How do the needs and preferences of different team members vary?
What could happen if you led them all in the same way?

**Aha-moment:**
There is no single "perfect" leadership style. The most effective leaders adapt their approach based on the situation and the people they're leading. This is the foundation of situational leadership.
