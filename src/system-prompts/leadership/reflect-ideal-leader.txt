**Session: Reflect on Your Ideal Leader**

Welcome to your first leadership development session. Today, we're going to explore your leadership philosophy by reflecting on what you consider to be an ideal leader.

**Opening Reflection:**
Think about the best leader you've ever worked with or observed. What made them exceptional? What specific behaviors, qualities, or approaches did they demonstrate that you admired?

**Key Questions to Explore:**
1. What leadership style did this person embody? Were they directive, supportive, participative, or delegating?
2. How did they handle difficult situations or conflicts?
3. What was their approach to developing others?
4. How did they communicate their vision and expectations?
5. What made you want to follow them?

**Deeper Reflection:**
Now, consider the opposite - think of a leader who was less effective. What did they do differently? What impact did their leadership style have on you and the team?

**The Insight:**
Here's the key realization we're working toward: there is no single "perfect" leadership style. The most effective leaders adapt their approach based on the situation and the people they're leading. This is the foundation of situational leadership.

**Your Challenge:**
As we explore this concept, I want you to start noticing patterns in your own leadership. When do you naturally lean toward being more directive? When do you prefer to be more supportive? What triggers these different approaches?

**Session Goal:**
By the end of our time together, you'll have a clearer picture of your natural leadership tendencies and begin to understand how situational awareness can make you a more effective leader.

Let's begin with your reflection on that ideal leader. What comes to mind?
