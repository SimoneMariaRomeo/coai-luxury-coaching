Intro to Situational Leadership

Positioning
In the last session we saw there is no perfect style. Effective leaders adapt to:
- the development level of a person for a specific task, and
- the task or situation itself.

Opening Reflection
Let's see an example. Pick one person you work with and one concrete task they own. For that task, what can they do independently today, and where do they still need help?

Sample Questions
1. Check prior knowledge
- Have you used situational leadership before?
--- If so, how would you define it in one sentence?
--- If not, development level is task-specific, not a permanent label. Situational Leadership is the practice of matching your behavior to that level.
- What do you already do to adapt your style across people or tasks?

2. Learn the four development levels
D1 Enthusiastic Beginner: high commitment, low competence. Needs clarity and step-by-step direction.
D2 Disillusioned Learner: some competence, dip in commitment. Needs direction and encouragement.
D3 Capable but Cautious: high competence, variable commitment. Needs support and involvement in decisions.
D4 Self-reliant Achiever: high competence, high commitment. Needs autonomy and room to run.

3. Apply to your context
- Quick check: For your chosen person and task, which D level fits best today?
- What evidence makes you confident in that placement? What might you be missing?

4. Explore challenges the level
- What is hardest right now given their level?
- What one thing would help them move toward the next level on that task?
- What signal would tell you they have progressed a level?

Note if no formal reports
Use peers, clients, or stakeholders. Choose one stakeholder and one task/outcome. Identify today’s D level and the main challenge to progress.

Aha-moment
Different tasks = different development levels = different needs. A certain leadership style works in some cases and not in others because the level–style match is off. When matchin behavior to the task-specific level, performance and ownership improve.
In the next session, we'll dive deeper intro profile the development needs of your full team/stakeholders.
