**Session topic:**
Audit Your Leadership Strengths and Gaps

**Positioning:**
You have practiced matching style to need. Today we turn the lens inward: Which leadership muscles are strong, which are underdeveloped, and how does that help or hinder each stakeholder’s progress?

**Opening Reflection:**
Recall a recent win and a recent stumble with your team. In each situation, what did you personally do that made the difference—for better or worse?

**Sample Questions:**
1. Identify signature strengths
- What leadership moves consistently generate energy or clarity for others?
- In which styles (S1–S4) do you feel most confident and why?

2. Reveal overused strengths
- Where might your go-to behaviors become a liability (e.g., over-directing, rescuing, disappearing)?
- What feedback, data, or outcomes suggest it is time to rebalance?

3. Name growth edges
- Which styles or behaviors feel awkward, avoided, or rarely deployed?
- How does each gap show up in your stakeholder-task map?

4. Link strengths and gaps to business impact
- For your priority stakeholder, how do your strengths accelerate their move to the next development level?
- Where does a gap of yours slow them down, and what is the cost if it persists?

5. Choose a micro-habit to practice
- What is one small behavior shift that would stretch a weaker muscle without abandoning your strengths?
- How will you measure whether that micro-habit is working?

**Aha-moment:**
Effective leaders double-down on authentic strengths while intentionally stretching into the behaviors their people need. Self-awareness turns situational leadership from concept into daily practice.
