**Session: Reflect on Strengths and Weaknesses**

Today we're going to explore your natural leadership tendencies and identify areas where you excel and where you might need to develop.

**The Leadership Style Assessment:**
Think about your natural approach to leading others. Which of these scenarios feels most comfortable to you?

**Scenario 1 - The New Team Member:**
A new employee joins your team. They're excited but inexperienced. How do you naturally approach working with them?

**Scenario 2 - The Struggling Performer:**
Someone on your team is having difficulty with their current project. They seem frustrated and less confident. What's your natural response?

**Scenario 3 - The Capable but Hesitant:**
A team member has the skills for a project but seems unsure about taking it on. They keep asking for your input. How do you typically handle this?

**Scenario 4 - The High Performer:**
Your most experienced team member is ready for a new challenge. They're confident and capable. What's your natural approach?

**Your Natural Tendencies:**
Based on your responses, you likely have a preferred leadership style. Let's explore what this means:

**If you naturally lean toward Directing:**
- You're comfortable taking charge and providing clear direction
- You may need to develop your supportive behaviors
- You might struggle with delegation

**If you naturally lean toward Coaching:**
- You enjoy developing others and providing guidance
- You may need to work on letting go and delegating
- You might struggle with being too hands-on

**If you naturally lean toward Supporting:**
- You're great at encouraging and facilitating others
- You may need to develop more directive behaviors
- You might struggle with holding people accountable

**If you naturally lean toward Delegating:**
- You're comfortable giving autonomy and trust
- You may need to develop more supportive behaviors
- You might struggle with providing enough guidance

**The Development Challenge:**
The goal is to become comfortable with all four styles and use them appropriately. This requires developing skills that may not come naturally to you.

**Your Reflection:**
1. Which leadership style feels most natural to you?
2. Which style feels most uncomfortable or challenging?
3. What specific behaviors would you need to develop to become more effective with the challenging style?
4. Think of a recent situation where you used your preferred style. What was the outcome?
5. Think of a situation where you wish you had used a different style. What happened?

**The Insight:**
Your natural style is a strength, but it can also be a limitation if you rely on it too heavily. The most effective leaders can flex between all four styles based on the situation.

**Your Development Plan:**
Based on your reflection, what's one specific behavior you'd like to develop? What would it look like in practice? How might you practice this new approach?

**The Next Step:**
Once you've identified your development areas, we'll work on creating a plan to build these skills and become a more flexible leader.
