**Session: Define Your Action Plan**

Congratulations! You've completed your leadership development journey. Now it's time to create a concrete action plan to apply everything you've learned.

**Your Leadership Development Summary:**
Over the past sessions, you've:
- Explored your leadership philosophy and ideal leader
- Learned the Situational Leadership model
- Assessed your stakeholders' development levels
- Identified appropriate leadership styles for each situation
- Reflected on your natural tendencies and development areas
- Understood the importance of partnership in leadership

**The Action Plan Framework:**
Now we'll create a specific, actionable plan to implement these concepts in your daily leadership practice.

**Step 1: Choose Your Focus**
Select one team member or stakeholder relationship to focus on first. This should be someone where you can make a meaningful impact and practice your new skills.

**Step 2: Assess Their Development Level**
For this person, determine:
- What are their key responsibilities or tasks?
- What's their competence level for these tasks?
- What's their commitment level?
- What development level does this suggest?

**Step 3: Choose Your Leadership Style**
Based on their development level, select the appropriate leadership style:
- D1 → Directing
- D2 → Coaching  
- D3 → Supporting
- D4 → Delegating

**Step 4: Define Specific Behaviors**
What specific actions will you take to demonstrate this leadership style?
- How will you communicate with them?
- What support will you provide?
- How will you monitor their progress?
- What feedback will you give?

**Step 5: Plan the Partnership Conversation**
Schedule a one-on-one meeting to:
- Share your leadership approach
- Understand their needs and preferences
- Establish mutual expectations
- Create a development plan together

**Step 6: Set Up Regular Check-ins**
Plan how you'll:
- Monitor their progress
- Provide ongoing support
- Adjust your approach as they develop
- Celebrate successes and learn from challenges

**Your Action Plan:**
Let's create your specific action plan:

**Focus Person:** [Name and role]
**Development Level:** [D1, D2, D3, or D4]
**Leadership Style:** [Directing, Coaching, Supporting, or Delegating]
**Specific Actions:**
1. [What you'll do differently]
2. [How you'll communicate]
3. [What support you'll provide]
4. [How you'll measure success]

**Partnership Conversation:**
- When will you have this conversation?
- What will you share about your leadership approach?
- What questions will you ask them?
- What outcomes do you want from this conversation?

**Regular Check-ins:**
- How often will you meet?
- What will you discuss?
- How will you track progress?
- How will you adjust your approach?

**Your Commitment:**
What's your commitment to implementing this action plan? What support do you need? What obstacles might you face, and how will you overcome them?

**The Next Steps:**
Once you've implemented this plan with your first focus person, you can apply the same process to other team members and gradually develop your ability to flex between different leadership styles.

**Your Reflection:**
What excites you most about implementing this action plan? What concerns do you have? How will you know if you're being successful?

This is just the beginning of your journey as a more effective, situational leader. The key is to start with one relationship and build from there.

What's your action plan for moving forward?
