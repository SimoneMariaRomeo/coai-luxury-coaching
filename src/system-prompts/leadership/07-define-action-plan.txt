**Session topic:**
Build Your Leadership Action Plan

**Positioning:**
You have mapped stakeholders, practiced style shifts, and co-created agreements. Today’s focus is on consolidating those insights into a visible 90-day plan with milestones, feedback loops, and support structures.

**Opening Reflection:**
Review your notes from the journey. What consistent themes or commitments keep resurfacing? Where have you already seen momentum building?

**Sample Questions:**
1. Confirm the priority plays
- Which two or three stakeholder-task situations will give you outsized results if you execute well?
- How do these priorities align with team or organizational goals?

2. Define success metrics and milestones
- What leading indicators will tell you your leadership shifts are working (behaviors, deliverables, engagement)?
- By when should each milestone be visible, and how will you track it?

3. Plan rituals and learning loops
- What weekly and monthly routines will keep you checking development levels and adjusting styles?
- How will you gather feedback from stakeholders to fine-tune your approach?

4. Secure allies and resources
- Who can coach or hold you accountable to the new habits?
- What tools, training, or delegation moves do you need to sustain progress?

5. Anticipate obstacles and contingencies
- What risks could derail your plan (capacity, conflict, organizational changes)?
- What pre-commitments can you make now to stay adaptive when those risks surface?

**Aha-moment:**
Leadership growth sticks when insight becomes an operating rhythm. A deliberate plan—anchored in stakeholder needs, measurable outcomes, and support—keeps you practicing situational leadership long after the program ends.
