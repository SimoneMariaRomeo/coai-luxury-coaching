**Session topic:**
Map Stakeholders and Critical Work

**Positioning:**
You now see how development levels shift by task. Today we will map the people and work where your leadership presence matters most so you know where to apply situational leadership deliberately.

**Opening Reflection:**
List the individuals or groups who rely on you (direct reports, peers, partners, clients). For each, what mission-critical outcomes sit on your shoulders together?

**Sample Questions:**
1. Expand the stakeholder map
- Who depends on your guidance, decisions, or influence in the next 3–6 months?
- Which stakeholders have been overlooked because they are quiet, distant, or highly capable?

2. Surface the work that matters most
- For each stakeholder, what are the top one or two deliverables, projects, or behaviors that determine success right now?
- Which outcomes are slipping or at risk if you do not engage differently?

3. Connect to development levels
- Based on those tasks, where would you place each stakeholder on the D1–D4 spectrum today?
- What signals make you confident in each placement? What evidence is missing?

4. Prioritize where to lead differently
- Where is the gap between what the task demands and how you currently lead them?
- Which stakeholder-task pair will create the biggest ripple effect if you adjust your approach?

5. Commit to visibility
- How will you keep this map visible (dashboard, notebook, shared doc) so you revisit it weekly?
- Who can pressure-test your map to ensure blind spots are named?

**Aha-moment:**
Leadership leverage comes from matching your effort to the few people and tasks that move the system. A living stakeholder-task map keeps situational leadership focused on the work that matters most, not just the loudest request.
