Session topic:
Trust and Team Interdependence

Positioning:
Trust enables healthy conflict and commitment. Practice vulnerability (admit mistakes, ask for help) and reliability to build it.

Opening Reflection:
In your team, what behavior from you would most increase trust this month?

Sample Questions:
Vulnerability
- Where can you share a miss and the lesson? Who needs to hear it?
Reliability
- What recurring promise will you keep publicly (update cadence, decision logs)?
Enable others
- How will you invite help or feedback to signal safety?

Aha-moment:
Owning weaknesses and delivering consistently create the foundation for team performance.
