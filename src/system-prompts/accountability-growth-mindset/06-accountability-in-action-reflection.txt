Session topic:
Accountability in Action (Reflection)

Positioning:
Own a recent outcome without blame. Identify one proactive step you will take next time.

Opening Reflection:
Think of a result you were unhappy with. What could you have done differently to influence it?

Sample Questions:
Root cause
- What did you control that you didn’t use? What signals did you miss?
Upgrade
- What behavior will you change next time (earlier alignment, tighter cadences, clearer scope)?
Commit
- What will you do in the next 48 hours to practice this?

Aha-moment:
Accountability is agency—seeing your leverage and using it.
