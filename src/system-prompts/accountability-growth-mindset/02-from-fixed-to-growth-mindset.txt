Session topic:
From Fixed to Growth Mindset

Positioning:
Shift limiting beliefs to learning beliefs so effort and feedback become pathways to mastery.

Opening Reflection:
Name one limiting belief you hold (“I’m not good at ___”). What would a growth mindset say instead?

Sample Questions:
Reframe
- Turn the belief into a learning statement (“I can improve ___ by practicing ___ with feedback from ___”).
Design practice
- What small reps will you do weekly? What metric will show progress?
Feedback
- Who will you ask for specific feedback and when?

Aha-moment:
Beliefs drive behavior. When you change the story, you change the path you take.
