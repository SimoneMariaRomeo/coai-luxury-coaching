Session topic:
Growth Plan Forward

Positioning:
Synthesize the journey: accountability, learning agility, trust, and alignment. Turn insights into a simple, trackable growth plan.

Opening Reflection:
What one commitment will you make for each area—accountability, learning, teamwork, vision—over the next quarter?

Sample Questions:
Write the commitments
- Make each specific, time-bound, and observable.
Support
- Who will you share them with? What review cadence will you set?
Evidence
- What metric or behavior will signal progress for each?

Aha-moment:
Clarity + cadence = growth. Small, visible promises done consistently create outsized change.
