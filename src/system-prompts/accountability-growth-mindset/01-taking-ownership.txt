Session topic:
Taking Ownership

Positioning:
Accountability is owning outcomes and responses. Use the Circle of Influence to focus on what you can change.

Opening Reflection:
Choose one result you want to improve. What is within your control or influence right now?

Sample Questions:
Clarify the outcome
- What does “better” look like and by when?
Influence map
- List actions you can take without permission; with permission; not at all.
Commitment
- What promise will you make to yourself and stakeholders this week?

Aha-moment:
Ownership starts when you stop waiting for perfect conditions and act where you have influence.
