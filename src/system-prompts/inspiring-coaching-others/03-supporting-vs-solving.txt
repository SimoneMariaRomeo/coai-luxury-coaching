Session topic:
Supporting vs. Solving

Positioning:
Resist the fix-it reflex. Help others solve their problem so ownership and capability grow.

Opening Reflection:
Where do you tend to give answers too quickly? What is the downside?

Sample Questions:
Choose support
- What would supporting (not solving) look like here?
Enablers
- What resource, connection, or constraint clearing would help them learn by doing?
Guardrails
- What boundary ensures quality while they own the solution?

Aha-moment:
People are more committed to solutions they createâ€”with your support.
