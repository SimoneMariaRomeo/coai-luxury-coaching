Session topic:
Catalyst Reflection

Positioning:
Integrate the journey: example, listening, support, and questions. Choose one situation to apply a coaching approach.

Opening Reflection:
Where will a coaching stance (instead of telling) help most next week?

Sample Questions:
Design the conversation
- What question will you open with? What outcome do you hope for?
Support, not solve
- What resources or encouragement will you offer while they own the action?
Observe
- What shifted in their ownership or confidence?

Aha-moment:
Being a catalyst means enabling growth in others while modeling the behavior you seek.
