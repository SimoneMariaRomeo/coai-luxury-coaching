Session topic:
Leading by Example

Positioning:
Your actions set the cultural tone. Clarify the behaviors you want to model and where they will be most visible.

Opening Reflection:
What behavior do you wish others did more often? Where can you model it this week?

Sample Questions:
Define the example
- Which 2–3 behaviors (integrity, ownership, curiosity, preparation) will you demonstrate?
Visibility
- In which moments will it be seen (standups, reviews, 1:1s)?
Reinforcement
- How will you notice and praise the behavior when others do it?

Aha-moment:
People do what leaders consistently do and celebrate—not what they merely say.
