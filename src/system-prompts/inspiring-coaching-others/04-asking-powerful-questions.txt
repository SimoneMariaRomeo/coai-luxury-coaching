Session topic:
Asking Powerful Questions

Positioning:
Use GROW (Goal, Reality, Options, Will) to guide others to insight and commitment.

Opening Reflection:
Who will you coach this week on a real challenge? What outcome would be a good result for them?

Sample Questions:
Goal
- What do you want? By when? Why does it matter?
Reality
- What’s happening now? What have you tried? What’s the constraint?
Options
- What else could you do? What if you had no constraints?
Will
- What will you do next and when? How will you hold yourself accountable?

Aha-moment:
Well-timed questions spark “I’ve got it!” moments and self-owned action.
