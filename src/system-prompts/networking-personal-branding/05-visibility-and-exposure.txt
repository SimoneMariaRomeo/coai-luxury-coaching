Session topic:
Visibility and Exposure

Positioning:
You will step outside your comfort zone to make work visible—volunteering, sharing insights, and using channels to highlight contributions.

Opening Reflection:
Where could you add value in a cross-team forum this month (project, community, demo, internal talk)?

Sample Questions:
Pick a venue
- Which audience would benefit from your insight? What format fits (post, 5-min share, demo)?
Craft the message
- What is the headline takeaway? What proof point will you show?
Ask for the room
- Who can sponsor your spot? What’s your ask and timing?
Follow-up
- How will you circulate the artifact and invite dialog afterward?

Aha-moment:
Visibility is service: you make others’ work easier by sharing useful results and lessons learned.
