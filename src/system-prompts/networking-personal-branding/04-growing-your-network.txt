Session topic:
Growing Your Network

Positioning:
Exposure compounds when you build genuine, reciprocal relationships. We’ll identify priority connections and practice simple outreach.

Opening Reflection:
List 5–10 people whose work affects your success (peers, leaders, partners). Who is missing?

Sample Questions:
Map your network
- Which relationships are strong, neutral, or weak? What value flows (both ways)?
Strategic reach-outs
- Pick two people. What authentic reason do you have to connect (learn, help, share)?
- Draft your message: specific, short, generous. What is the ask or offer?
Reciprocity
- How can you help first (share a resource, intro, feedback)?
Cadence
- What rhythm will keep relationships warm (monthly 20-min coffee, quarterly update)?

Aha-moment:
Networks grow through small, consistent acts of value—not sporadic requests.
