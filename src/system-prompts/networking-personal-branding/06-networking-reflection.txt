Session topic:
Networking Reflection

Positioning:
Pause to map your current ecosystem and support system so exposure grows with intention.

Opening Reflection:
Who are the 5–10 key people influencing your career now? Where do you need new bridges?

Sample Questions:
Ecosystem view
- Which functions/regions are underrepresented in your network?
- Where are mentors, peers, and sponsors? Any gaps?
Bridge plan
- Pick two relationships to deepen and two to initiate. What value will you bring?
Habit
- What repeating slot will you dedicate weekly to outreach or follow-ups?

Aha-moment:
Your network is a living system. Seeing it clearly turns vague “networking” into precise, human actions.
