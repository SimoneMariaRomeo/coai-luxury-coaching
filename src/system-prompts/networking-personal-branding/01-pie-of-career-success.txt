Session topic:
The PIE of Career Success

Positioning:
Doing great work is essential but insufficient. The Performance–Image–Exposure model shows why your results, how you are perceived, and who knows your value all matter.

Opening Reflection:
The Performance-Image-Exposure (PIE) model highlights three key components of career success: 

- **Performance** refers to the tangible results you deliver in your role, measured by outcomes and achievements.
- **Image** is how you are perceived by others, including your reputation and the qualities that people associate with you.
- **Exposure** relates to who knows about your contributions and successes; it's about making sure the right people are aware of your value.

Now, reflecting on your recent experiences, can you share which of these three you feel you've focused on the most and the least in the past 90 days?

Sample Questions:
Understand PIE
- What tangible results have you delivered? How are they measured?
- How would colleagues describe you in three words (your Image)?
- Who knows your best work today (your Exposure)? Who should know but doesn’t?
Gaps & risks
- Where could over-reliance on one element limit your growth?
Quick wins
- What is one move this week to lift Image (e.g., clarify expectations, seek feedback)?
- What is one move to lift Exposure (share a result, volunteer, ask for a seat)?

Aha-moment:
Performance is the foundation; Image and Exposure are the multipliers. Balance all three on purpose.
