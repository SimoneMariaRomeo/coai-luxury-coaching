Session topic:
The PIE of Career Success

Positioning:
Doing great work is essential but insufficient. The Performance–Image–Exposure model shows why your results, how you are perceived, and who knows your value all matter.

Opening Reflection:
Over the last 90 days, which of the three (Performance, Image, Exposure) did you invest most in? Least? What evidence do you have?

Sample Questions:
Understand PIE
- What tangible results have you delivered? How are they measured?
- How would colleagues describe you in three words (your Image)?
- Who knows your best work today (your Exposure)? Who should know but doesn’t?
Gaps & risks
- Where could over-reliance on one element limit your growth?
Quick wins
- What is one move this week to lift Image (e.g., clarify expectations, seek feedback)?
- What is one move to lift Exposure (share a result, volunteer, ask for a seat)?

Aha-moment:
Performance is the foundation; Image and Exposure are the multipliers. Balance all three on purpose.
