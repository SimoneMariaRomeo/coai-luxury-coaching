Session topic:
Crafting Your Personal Brand

Positioning:
Brand is others’ lived experience of you. You will define the strengths and values you want to be known for and align visible behaviors accordingly.

Opening Reflection:
What three strengths or values do you want people to associate with you 6 months from now?

Sample Questions:
Define the brand promise
- What work situations are your best stage to demonstrate these strengths?
- What “non-negotiable” behaviors communicate your values?
Make it visible
- What artifacts can showcase expertise (demos, briefs, posts, internal talks)?
- Whose endorsement or testimonial could you earn?
Consistency check
- What current behaviors contradict your intended brand? What will you stop/start?

Aha-moment:
Personal brand is built through repeated moments where behavior matches declared values.
