Session topic:
Building Trust through Performance

Positioning:
Trust starts with delivering on promises. You will sharpen how you set expectations and follow through so performance reliably builds your reputation.

Opening Reflection:
Identify one commitment that matters to stakeholders this month. What does “done” look like and by when?

Sample Questions:
Clarify outcomes
- What problem does this work solve for others? What is the success metric?
Plan the follow-through
- What checkpoints will you schedule? With whom? What is your communication rhythm?
Surface risks early
- What could derail delivery? What is your mitigation plan?
Finish strong
- How will you package and communicate the result so value is visible?

Aha-moment:
Consistent clarity + delivery create compounding trust. Make the value of your work legible.
