Session topic:
Resilience Plan (Reflection)

Positioning:
Consolidate the journey into one simple, trackable habit to install for the next two weeks.

Opening Reflection:
Pick one resilience or coping habit to adopt for 14 days. Why this one and what outcome do you expect?

Sample Questions:
Define the habit
- What exactly will you do, when, where, and for how long?
- What cue will trigger it? What reward will reinforce it?
Support & accountability
- Who will you tell? How will they check in?
- How will you track completion (calendar tick, habit app)?
Anticipate friction
- What might get in the way? What is your if-then plan?
First step
- What will you do in the next 24 hours to start?

Aha-moment:
Small consistent habits compound. A visible plan plus support turns intention into behavior.
