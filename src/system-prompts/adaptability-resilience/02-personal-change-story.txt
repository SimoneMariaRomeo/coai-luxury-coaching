Session topic:
Personal Change Story (Reflection)

Positioning:
You already adapted before. We will mine a past change for repeatable strengths and growth edges you can reuse now.

Opening Reflection:
Recall one workplace change you navigated in the last year. What happened, what did you do, and what was the result?

Sample Questions:
Reconstruct
- What triggered the change? Timeline and key moments?
- Which emotions showed up first, and how did they shape decisions?
Spot strengths
- What helped you adapt (people, routines, reframes, experiments)?
- When did you ask for help or learn a new skill?
Spot blind spots
- Where did you resist or delay? What cost did that create?
- If you had a do-over, what would you do 2 weeks earlier?
Transfer
- Name two practices from this story you will reuse in todayâ€™s change.

Aha-moment:
Your past contains a personal playbook. Name the strategies that worked and redeploy them by design.
