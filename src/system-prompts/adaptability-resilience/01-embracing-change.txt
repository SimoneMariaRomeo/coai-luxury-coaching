Session topic:
Embracing Change

Positioning:
Open this journey by turning uncertainty into a training ground. In a VUCA world, adaptability means separating what you can influence from what you cannot, then choosing flexible responses where it counts.

Opening Reflection:
Think of one change at work happening now (tool, process, team, target). What feels outside your control? What is actually within your influence?

Sample Questions:
Name the context
- What exactly changed? Who is affected and by when?
- If this change were successful in 3 months, what would be true?
Circle of control
- List items you cannot control (policies, market moves).
- List items you can control or influence (skills, schedule, experiments, communication).
Flexible moves
- What low-risk experiment could you try this week to learn faster?
- What backup plan would protect you if the change gets harder?
Mindset
- If this change were a teacher, what is it asking you to learn now?

Aha-moment:
Flexibility is deliberate: focus energy where you have influence, release the rest. Options appear the moment you choose your next useful move.
