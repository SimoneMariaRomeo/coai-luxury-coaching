Session topic:
Resilience Toolbox

Positioning:
Resilience is built, not born. We will assemble practical levers: optimism, social support, self-confidence, and recovery rituals.

Opening Reflection:
Rate yourself 1–5 on optimism, social support, self-confidence, and recovery (sleep, breaks). Which two are lowest today?

Sample Questions:
Map supports
- Who are your three go-to people in challenge? How will you check in with each this week?
Build optimism
- What alternative story about this situation is both true and helpful?
- What small daily win can you log to train attention toward progress?
Reinforce confidence
- List three past situations you handled well. What strengths did you use?
- Create a brief mantra for pressure moments (e.g., “I can do hard things in small steps”).
Protect recovery
- Which 10-minute habit will protect energy (walk, breathwork, no-notifications block)?

Aha-moment:
Resilience emerges from stacked practices. Strengthen one factor and the overall capacity to bounce back rises.
