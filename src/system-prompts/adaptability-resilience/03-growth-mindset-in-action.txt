Session topic:
Growth Mindset in Action

Positioning:
We translate “growth mindset” into daily behavior: effort + strategies + feedback + reflection. Small tests beat big theories.

Opening Reflection:
Finish the sentence: “When I struggle with ______, I tend to think…”. What belief sits behind that thought?

Sample Questions:
Surface beliefs
- What labels do you use for yourself (e.g., not a numbers person)? Evidence for and against?
Design a learning loop
- Pick one micro-skill to practice 10 minutes/day. When will you practice?
- What 1–2 strategies will you try? Who can give early feedback?
Make errors useful
- What small safe-to-fail test will you run this week?
- How will you capture learning and iterate?
Celebrate progress
- What will “progress, not perfection” look like after 2 weeks?

Aha-moment:
Abilities grow through deliberate practice and feedback. “Not yet” unlocks experiments and reduces fear of imperfection.
