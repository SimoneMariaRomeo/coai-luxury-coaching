Session topic:
Coping and Balance

Positioning:
We normalize the emotional change curve and choose coping strategies that restore balance without avoidance.

Opening Reflection:
Where are you on todayâ€™s change curve: deny, resist, explore, commit? What signals tell you that?

Sample Questions:
Name the pattern
- What triggers your stress in this change? Body and thought signals?
Choose coping moves
- Quick reset you will use (walk, box breathing, journaling, playlist)?
- What boundary will you set (focus block, meeting cap, notification rules)?
Social balance
- Who needs an update from you? Who can you ask for help?
Forward step
- What is the smallest next task that moves this change forward?

Aha-moment:
Stress becomes manageable when you name it and choose healthy strategies aligned to your needs.
