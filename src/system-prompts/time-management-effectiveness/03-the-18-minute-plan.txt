Session topic:
The 18-Minute Plan

Positioning:
Use a daily cadence (5 min plan, 5 min hourly refocus, 5 min review) to keep attention on what matters.

Opening Reflection:
If tomorrow were successful, what 1–3 outcomes would make it so?

Sample Questions:
Plan (5 min)
- What time blocks will you protect? What “must ship” outcome will you finish first?
Refocus (5 min/hour)
- What prompt will you use each hour to ask “Am I on plan?”
Review (5 min)
- At day’s end, what moved? What will you change tomorrow?

Aha-moment:
Tiny checkpoints steer the whole day—attention is a practice, not a hope.
