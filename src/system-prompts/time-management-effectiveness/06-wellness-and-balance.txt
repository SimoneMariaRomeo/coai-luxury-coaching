Session topic:
Wellness and Balance

Positioning:
Sustained performance comes from honoring personal needs. Use a quick well-being wheel to find one area to lift.

Opening Reflection:
Rate 1â€“5: sleep, movement, nutrition, focus time, relationships, fun. Which score is lowest?

Sample Questions:
Select the lever
- What tiny habit would lift that area one point this week?
Integration
- Where will it fit in your day? What cue will trigger it?
Support
- Who can cheer or join you?

Aha-moment:
Balance is built from small daily deposits, not grand resets.
