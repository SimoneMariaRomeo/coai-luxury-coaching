Session topic:
Personal Effectiveness Plan (Reflection)

Positioning:
Consolidate two changes you will keep for the next 30 days and decide how you will track them.

Opening Reflection:
Which two practices from this journey improved your day most? Why?

Sample Questions:
Define the two changes
- What, when, where, and how will you execute each?
Tracking
- Where will you log completion? What weekly review will you run?
Risk & recovery
- What may derail you and what is your restart plan?

Aha-moment:
Simple, trackable routines make effectiveness a habit, not a hope.
