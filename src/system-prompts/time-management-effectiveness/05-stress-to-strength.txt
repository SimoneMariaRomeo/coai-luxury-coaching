Session topic:
Stress to Strength

Positioning:
Reframe stress and use physical, mental, and practical tactics to turn pressure into performance.

Opening Reflection:
Where is stress highest right now? What is the specific demand?

Sample Questions:
Physical
- Which quick body reset will you use (breathing, stretch, hydration, walk)? When?
Mental
- What reframe or self-talk moves you from threat to challenge?
Practical
- Which 4D will you apply (Delete, Delegate, Defer, Do)?

Aha-moment:
Stress can be fuel when you choose helpful responses across body, mind, and work design.
