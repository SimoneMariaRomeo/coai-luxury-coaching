Session topic:
Prioritization Matrix

Positioning:
Tame the urgent vs. important dilemma using a simple matrix to protect high-value work.

Opening Reflection:
List your 10 current tasks. Which are truly important but not urgent?

Sample Questions:
Sort
- Place each task in a quadrant (Urgent/Important; Not Urgent/Important; Urgent/Not Important; Neither).
Decide
- What will you schedule, delegate, decline, or drop? Why?
Boundaries
- What language will you use to say “not now” respectfully?

Aha-moment:
Saying “no” to low-value urgency is saying “yes” to meaningful progress.
