Session topic:
Knowing Your Productivity Style

Positioning:
One size does not fit all. Diagnose how you naturally work so you can pick methods that fit.

Opening Reflection:
When did you feel most effective in the last two weeks? Least effective? What was different?

Sample Questions:
Self-diagnostic
- Do you lean Planner, Prioritizer, Arranger, or Visualizer? Evidence?
Fit methods
- Which methods match your style (time-blocking, kanban, daily top-3, batching)?
Friction
- What derails you most (context-switching, meetings, unclear goals)?
Choice
- Which two practices will you test next week?

Aha-moment:
Productivity improves when your system fits youâ€”not the other way around.
