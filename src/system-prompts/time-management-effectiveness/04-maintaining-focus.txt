Session topic:
Maintaining Focus

Positioning:
Deep work beats constant switching. Practice focus sprints and boundary-setting to guard attention.

Opening Reflection:
What task deserves 25 minutes of uninterrupted focus today?

Sample Questions:
Set the sprint
- When will you run a Pomodoro (25 on, 5 off)? What will you turn off?
Boundaries
- What interruption will you preempt (status, DND, door, calendar note)?
Debrief
- After two sprints, what output improved vs. multitasking?

Aha-moment:
Protecting attention multiplies quality and speed.
